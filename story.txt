Once upon a time, there was a starving utopia. It was the year 2070, and the world is wracked with starvation. The only 
saving grace is God's fruit, aka the pineapple. People constantly rebelled against the pineapple.
As a new rebellion heated up in the south, Chrasdrewper, a young, fresh-faced lieutenant and head of
the Rebellion Crushers, is sent to put a stop the the conflict.
Unfortunatly, Chrasdrewper could not stop the rebellion. After the rebellion, the pineapple won and decided to punish the
people. The pineapple made a jail and put everyone who went against him in that jail. The people regret what they had done. 

While the people were in jail, they created an inner society that divided those in captivity. Those who believed
pineapple belonged on a pizza, and those who believed pineapple didn't belonged on pizza. Those who believed called
themselves the Pineapplers and the others called themselves the PiNOPElers. The great divide led to the Pineapplers
attempting to escape captivity and put the Pineapple on a pizza once and for all.

Seven years later, which is 2077. The people felt that the civil war cannot solve the problem. Humans gathered all 
the scientists in captivity to study how to figure out this crisis. In the end, Dr.pepper found a solution. 
He divided the pizza into two parts, half with pineapples and half without pineapples. Since then, humanity united 
together.

And thus, our story comes to an end. People, united together under the Pineapple Pizza. Those who dissented quickly
converted to fit under the new regime, as they were tired of a 7-year war. Everyone lives happily ever after...until
the Apple Pizza Society came into fruition. A demonic cult, the members of this society started to plan on 
sabotaging all things pineapple. But that shall be saved for another time. The End.
