Once upon a time, there was a starving utopia. It was the year 2070, and the world is wracked with starvation. The only 
saving grace is God's fruit, aka the pineapple. People constantly rebelled against the pineapple.
As a new rebellion heated up in the south, Chrasdrewper, a young, fresh-faced lieutenant and head of
the Rebellion Crushers, is sent to put a stop the the conflict.
Unfortunatly, Chrasdrewper could not stop the rebellion. After the rebellion, the pineapple won and decided to punish the
people. The pineapple made a jail and put everyone who went against him in that jail. The people regret what they had done. 

While the people were in jail, they created an inner society that divided those in captivity. Those who believed
pineapple belonged on a pizza, and those who believed pineapple didn't belonged on pizza. Those who believed called
themselves the Pineapplers and the others called themselves the PiNOPElers. The great divide led to the Pineapplers
attempting to escape captivity and put the Pineapple on a pizza once and for all.
