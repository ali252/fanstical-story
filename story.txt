Once upon a time, there was a starving utopia. It was the year 2070, and the world is wracked with starvation. The only 
saving grace is God's fruit, aka the pineapple. People constantly rebelled against the pineapple.
As a new rebellion heated up in the south, Chrasdrewper, a young, fresh-faced lieutenant and head of
the Rebellion Crushers, is sent to put a stop the the conflict.
